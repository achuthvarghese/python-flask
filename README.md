# Python Flask Web Application Tutorials

Each tutorial has its own directory in the naming format of `tutorial([0-9]*)` and consists of its own files and folders i.e, the structure might change for each tutorial directory.  

Before running the application make sure to be in the intended tutorial directory by using the change directory command.

## Setup Virtual Environment

Install virtual environment in the [main directoy]. There is a [main requirements.txt] and each directory would have its own `requirements.txt`. Use the requirements file in the directory to install the dependencies.
